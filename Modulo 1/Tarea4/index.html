                <h3>Mission</h3>

                <p>To support young athletes living in Chicago´s northside neighborhoods, who have an interest in learning and playing soccer, with opportunities to learn and practise skills related to the game of soccer, specifically those skills around team cooperation and good sportsmanship</p>
                <h3>Vision</h3>

                <p>The Northside Youth Soccer League aspires to develop strong, well-rounded, and mindful athletes through the building of character, self discipline, and leadership.</p>

                <h3>General Information</h3>

                <p>The Northside Youth Soccer League was established in 1996 to provide athletes residing in Chiacago´s northside neighborhoods an environment in which to learn and play soccer. To be a member of NYSL, you must be between the ages of 4 - 12 and reside in a Chicago northside neighborhood. NYSL is ran by a small full-time staff, and relies on the generous volunteer time of parents and previous league members.</p>

                        <h3> SPORTSMANSHIP </h3>
                        <p>The common interest that members of the Association share is to inspire
                            youth to practice the ideals of sportsmanship and fair play. Any player,
                            coach, team, parent, spectator, administrator or referee whose behavior
                            detracts from this purpose is subject to disciplinary action regardless of
                            technical soccer background, expertise, accomplishments or standing.</p>

                        <h3>FIFA FIELD REGULATIONS</h3>
                        <p><strong>DIMENSIONS. </strong>FIFA Law 1 provides for flexible external field dimensions
                            within a given maximum and minimum width and length. These
                            dimensions should be adhered to for all fields used by teams under 12
                            and older.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>COMPETITION FIELDS. </strong> Fields used within the competition program must
                            be a minimum of 100 x 60 yards. Leagues, districts or associations
                            participating in the state competition program that are unable to provide a
                            field that meets these minimum requirements must advise the State
                            Competition Board which will assign its Fields Committee to inspect the
                            field and recommend to the Board whether or not a waiver of the minimum
                            dimensions should be granted. Teams from leagues, districts or
                            associations that are unable to provide an acceptable field may be
                            required to play all their games away.</p>

                                <p>U-6 play on a field approximately 20 X 40 yards with no penalty
                                    areas. Fields for older age groups should be progressively larger.</p>

                                <p>U-8 plays on a field 40-50 yards in length and 20-30 yards width</p>

                                    U-10 play on a field 70-80 yards in length and 40-50 yards in width.

                                    In addition, fields used by young age groups may have their internal
                                    dimensions and size of goal similarly modified.

                                            The decision for team/spectator placement on the field will
                                            be made by the governing body of that team. A team’s
                                            bench area shall consist of that area at least one (1) yard
                                            away from the touchline and extending to twenty yards (20)
                                            both ways from the halfway line. In the event that field

                                            conditions require team benches to be on the same side of
                                            the field, a team’s bench area shall consist of that area two
                                            (2) yards away from the touchline and extending twenty
                                            yards one (1) way from the halfway line.

                                            The home team has first choice as to where it wishes to
                                            locate its bench area. Coaches and substitutes are required
                                            to remain within their bench area during the game. Parents
                                            and spectators should occupy the same side of the field as
                                            the team they are supporting.
                                        </p>

                                        the team bench areas. Supporters of a team must assemble
                                        on the side of the midfield facing the team bench area of that
                                        team. There shall be a buffer zone extending ten yards on
                                        each side of the midfield that may not be occupied by
                                        parents or spectators. Match officials shall be empowered to
                                        enforce these provisions and may suspend or terminate
                                        games in the event that any team, coach, parent, or
                                        spectator declines to abide by requests from match officials
                                        to comply with these standards.

                            start a sanctioned game. No more than eleven (11) players per team may

                            Association (USYSA) rules. It is strongly recommended that U-6 and U-8
                            play 4 v 4. UYSA shall not sanction games involving teams under 10 or
                            younger unless such games are conducted with not more than eight (8)
                            players per side. (National rule 4036 section 2)</p>

                        <p>
                            Passes of any individual(s) ejected from any match shall be retained after
                            the match by the referee. The pass of any individual who has received a
                            third caution (yellow card) during a playing year shall be confiscated by
                            the referee at the conclusion of the match in which the third caution was
                            received. That player will be suspended from playing in the next game in
                            which the offending participant would otherwise be eligible to participate.
                            This process will continue so that for every third yellow card received
                            during a playing year, the player will be suspended from playing in the
                            next game (after the receipt of a third yellow card) for which the offending
                            participate would otherwise be eligible to participate. The referee shall
                            deliver all confiscated passes to the UYSA State Office within forty-eight
                            (48) hours of the conclusion of the match.

                            The referee shall verify the identity of the players and coaches with his/her
                            player pass. He shall collect the passes of those players and coaches who
                            are to participate in the game. The referee must allow no player into the
                            game for whom he/she has no pass.

                            UYSA offices within four (4) days, holidays excluded. If a coach or a
                            player is ejected, the referee report form is required within forty-eight (48)
                            hours along with the player/coach pass.

                            assistant coach, or team captain of teams participating in that game. Prior
                            to the game a coach may decide to postpone the game if the referees do
                            not produce the requested documentation. The game is to be replayed at
                            a later date.
